## Welcome :)

#### About me
Hello, I am GeckoNerd/JustKenux! I am just a backend developer, 
who loves esoteric proglangs, 
and I love writing some weird stuff, or reinventing bicycles 
and stuff. Many projects of mine in my repos are old and were 
made when I was much less experienced. Right now, there aren't 
many repos here - I removed all old and irrellevant ones and now 
I'm working on some projects to then publish them here.
